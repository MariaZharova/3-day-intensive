This Machine Learning basics video will help you understand what Machine Learning is, what are the types of Machine Learning - supervised, unsupervised & reinforcement learning, how Machine Learning works with simple examples, and will also explain how Machine Learning is being used in various industries. Machine learning is a core sub-area of artificial intelligence; it enables computers to get into self-learning mode without being explicitly programmed. When exposed to new data, these computer programs are enabled to learn, grow, change, and develop by themselves. So, the iterative aspect of machine learning is the ability to adapt to new data independently. This is possible as programs learn from previous computations and use ‚Äúpattern recognition‚Äù to produce reliable results.

The below topics are explained in this Machine Learning basics video:
1. What is Machine Learning? ( 00:21 )
2. Types of Machine Learning ( 02:43 )
2. What is Supervised Learning? ( 02:53 )
3. What is Unsupervised Learning? ( 03:46 )
4. What is Reinforcement Learning? ( 04:37 )
5. Machine Learning applications ( 06:25 )

Typo correction: At 14 minutes 45 seconds, the last index on the bias vector is n, when it's supposed to in fact be a k.  Thanks for the sharp eyes that caught that!

For those who want to learn more, I highly recommend the book by Michael Nielsen introducing neural networks and deep learning: https://goo.gl/Zmczdy

There are two neat things about this book.  First, it's available for free, so consider joining me in making a donation Nielsen's way if you get something out of it.  And second, it's centered around walking through some code and data which you can download yourself, and which covers the same example that I introduce in this video.  Yay for active learning!

I also highly recommend Chris Olah's blog: http://colah.github.io/

2:33 Squiggly Line fit to the training data
3:40 Model performance with the testing dataset
4:06 Definition of Variance
5:10 Definition of Overfit

Correction:
4:06 I say that the difference in fits between the training dataset and the testing dataset is called Variance. However, I should have said that the difference is a _consequence_ of variance. Technically, variance refers to the amount by which the predictions would change if we fit the model to a different training data set.

18,Y5x8xvDnLXk,2022-11-04T04:00:08Z,J. Maya  - Machine Learning (Official Lyric Video),"""Machine Learning‚Äù is a song about social performance, about what happens when you construct so many different versions of yourself to please others that you lose sight of the ""real"" you. As someone who's struggled their entire life with social anxiety, I find I sometimes feel like a robot, constantly programming my behavior to maximize my social output and make other people happy -- even at the expense of my own feelings. Growing up being dubbed the ""weird"" kid left me with a deep fear of exclusion; ""Machine Learning"" is my attempt to chronicle what it was like to bury that ""weirdness"" for years before I grew the confidence to show my authentic self to the world.

It truly means the world to me that I get to be so vulnerable in my music with you. Thank you for everything. I hope you enjoy this ro-bop. :)

From spam filters and self-driving cars, to cutting edge medical diagnosis and real-time language translation, there has been an increasing need for our computers to learn from data and apply that knowledge to make predictions and decisions. This is the heart of machine learning which sits inside the more ambitious goal of artificial intelligence. We may be a long way from self-aware computers that think just like us, but with advancements in deep learning and artificial neural networks our computers are becoming more powerful than ever.

27,reY50t2hbuM,2020-10-01T20:31:50Z,Why You Should NOT Learn Machine Learning!,"Everyone tells you why you should be learning machine learning. It is the next 'big thing' after all. But in this video I'm going to be telling you why you should NOT learn machine learning. 

There are many reasons for not starting machine learning. Some of these are:
1. Don't get into ML just because it is popular. Basically do not FOMO into it.
2. Machine learning is a huge field, there are so many things to do. You might start it but eventually give up because you don't know what exactly you want to build using ML/AI.
3. Just because you saw people getting paid more for machine learning jobs doesn't mean you should start it. As you can still polish your skills in other computer science related fields.

Even though I mention why you should not be get into machine learning, this doesn't mean that you should not at least give it a go. This video is only made for some people who want to get into ML/AI without having any major goal.

C++ is an enhanced and extended version of the C programming language, developed by Bjarne Stroustrup in 1979 as part of his Ph.D. project. Bjarne developed what he called ‚ÄòC with Classes‚Äô (later renamed C++) because he felt limited by the existing programming languages that were not ideal for large-scale projects. He used C to build what he wanted because C was already a general-purpose language that was efficient and fast in its operations.

‚úÖC++ Career Prospects:
With just C++ programming expertise, you will have excellent job opportunities, salaries, and career prospects. However, for a career based on programming languages such as Java and Python (which are in more demand than C++) or for careers based on front-end, back-end, and full-stack development, you will go a lot further with C++ expertise. Furthermore, in development domains such as software testing, you are expected to know C++.

46,CqMUp6NmQ9M,2021-12-27T19:35:15Z,What is the C++ Delusion in 2022?,"The point of this video is to help people understand that C++ operates within a certain context. It does a certain TYPE of programming that is unrelated to what the higher level languages do. As such, learning C++ will not have a major impact on your skills with higher level languages.

... Two different games. 

This is NOT a dig at C++ ... just helping to display the idea that somehow C++ skills will give you an advantage with higher level languages. It doesn't hurt to learn C++, and it will improve your abilities as a developer, but no more so than learning any other language.

‚úÖWhat is C++ Programming? 
C++ is an enhanced and extended version of the C programming language, developed by Bjarne Stroustrup in 1979 as part of his Ph.D. project. Bjarne developed what he called ‚ÄòC with Classes‚Äô (later renamed C++) because he felt limited by the existing programming languages that were not ideal for large scale projects. He used C to build what he wanted because C was already a general-purpose language that was efficient and fast in its operations.

‚úÖC++ Career Prospects:
With just C++ programming expertise, you will have excellent job opportunities, salaries, and career prospects. However, for a career based on programming languages such as Java and Python (which are in more demand than C++) or for careers based on front-end, back-end, and full-stack development, you will go a lot further with C++ expertise. Furthermore, in development domains such as software testing, you are expected to know C++.

JavaScript is one of the most popular programming languages in 2022. A lot of people are learning JavaScript to become front-end and/or back-end developers. 

I've designed this JavaScript tutorial for beginners to learn JavaScript from scratch. We'll start off by answering the frequently asked questions by beginners about JavaScript and shortly after we'll set up our development environment and start coding. 

Whether you're a beginner and want to learn to code, or you know any programming language and just want to learn JavaScript for web development, this tutorial helps you learn JavaScript fast. 

You don't need any prior experience with JavaScript or any other programming languages. Just watch this JavaScript tutorial to the end and you'll be writing JavaScript code in no time. 

If you want to become a front-end developer, you have to learn JavaScript. It is the programming language that every front-end developer must know. 

You can also use JavaScript on the back-end using Node. Node is a run-time environment for executing JavaScript code outside of a browser. With Node and Express (a popular JavaScript framework), you can build back-end of web and mobile applications. 

If you're looking for a crash course that helps you get started with JavaScript quickly, this course is for you.

66,U8542COlBiU,2021-07-13T10:35:43Z,"What is HTML, CSS and JavaScript? What is Frontend and Backend Development?","What is HTML What is CSS and What is JavaScript?  Front End vs Back End

Firstly you should know that back-end development¬† is the opposite of front end. back end is usually associated with languages like python and is used to establish the functionality of a website. however the look of the website is made with front-end development programs. Front end development is a combination of HTML, CSS and JS along with a load of other programs such as bootstrap, node.js, github, react and more.¬† however the three main languages HTML CSS and JavaScript are really what you need to know as a front end developer.

But what are these programs about and why do front end developers need them?

Why learn Python?

Programmers love Python because of how fast and easy it is to use. Python cuts development time in half with its simple to read syntax and easy compilation feature. Debugging your programs is a breeze in Python with its built in debugger. Using Python makes Programmers more productive and their programs ultimately better. Python continues to be a favorite option for data scientists who use it for building and using Machine learning applications and other scientific computations.
Python runs on Windows, Linux/Unix, Mac OS and has been ported to Java and .NET virtual machines. Python is free to use, even for the commercial products, because of its OSI-approved open source license. 
Python has evolved as the most preferred Language for Data Analytics and the increasing search trends on python also indicates that Python is the next ""Big Thing"" and a must for Professionals in the Data Analytics domain.

NOTE: Check description for updated Notebook links.

Data Analysis has been around for a long time, but up until a few years ago, it was practiced using closed, expensive and limited tools like Excel or Tableau. Python, SQL and other open libraries have changed Data Analysis forever.

In this tutorial you'll learn the whole process of Data Analysis: reading data from multiple sources (CSVs, SQL, Excel, etc), processing them using NumPy and Pandas, visualize them using Matplotlib and Seaborn and clean and process it to create reports.
Additionally, we've included a thorough Jupyter Notebook tutorial, and a quick Python reference to refresh your programming skills.

In this video we use Python Pandas & Python Matplotlib to analyze and answer business questions about 12 months worth of sales data. The data contains hundreds of thousands of electronics store purchases broken down by month, product type, cost, purchase address, etc. 

Setup!
Github source code & data: https://github.com/KeithGalli/Pandas-Data-Science-Tasks 
Installing Jupyter Notebook: https://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html 
Installing Pandas library: https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/install.html 

Check out the first video I did on Pandas:
https://youtu.be/vmEHCJofslg 

Check out the videos I did on Matplotlib:
https://youtu.be/DAQNHzOcO5A
https://youtu.be/0P7QnIQDBJY

Detailed video description! (timeline can be found in comments)

We start by cleaning our data. Tasks during this section include:
- Drop NaN values from DataFrame
- Removing rows based on a condition
- Change the type of columns (to_numeric, to_datetime, astype)

Once we have cleaned up our data a bit, we move the data exploration section. In this section we explore 5 high level business questions related to our data:
- What was the best month for sales? How much was earned that month?
- What city sold the most product?
- What time should we display advertisemens to maximize the likelihood of customer‚Äôs buying product?
- What products are most often sold together?
- What product sold the most? Why do you think it sold the most?

To answer these questions we walk through many different pandas & matplotlib methods. They include:
- Concatenating multiple csvs together to create a new DataFrame (pd.concat)
- Adding columns
- Parsing cells as strings to make new columns (.str)
- Using the .apply() method
- Using groupby to perform aggregate analysis
- Plotting bar charts and lines graphs to visualize our results
- Labeling our graphs

131,b0L47BeklTE,2019-07-25T15:43:15Z,Linear Regression Python Sklearn [FROM SCRATCH],"linear regression python sklearn. In this video we will learn how to use SkLearn for linear regression in Python. You can follow along with this linear regression sklearn python example. The linear regression in python will be done using SKlearn. The first thing we need to do is import. We will import a pydataset to use in this example. And let‚Äôs get Pandas and numpy. Next we import the thing we will need from sklearn. LinearRegression from the linear_model package, train test split, and lastly let‚Äôs get matplotlib in there so we can visualize this model. First of all, let‚Äôs get our data. We will be using the Pima women data. If you ever want to see details about a dataset you can enter in the keyword. Let‚Äôs check this data to see if it is approximately linear. In this example we will see if tricep skin fold measurements can predict body mass index (BMI). We can use the pandas plotting capabilities, with kind as scatter. There is the plot. This looks decently linear. So we will proceed with the model. Now we are going to do a test train split. We are doing supervised learning. Basically we create the model using only the training data, and then we use that model to see how well it predicts the testing data. Let‚Äôs plot the train test split so you can see what I mean. Everything in red will be used to create our line, and that line will be tested against the green data. Okay, so now let‚Äôs actually create the linear mode. LR.fit() and we will plug in X_train and y_train.  We reshape X_train because the input must be two dimensional. So .reshape(-1,1) will work just fine. Now let‚Äôs use this model to predict on the test data. We will plot that against a scatter plot of the actual test data. Here it is. The line is the model prediction and the green points are the actual data. It seems to do a decent job at following the overall trend. There may be some outliers.  Suppose we want to see how the model will predict a specific skin fold measurement, say 50. Let‚Äôs plug that in and see. Alright, now we will score the model using Sklearn‚Äôs built-in score function. and it came out at .39‚Ä¶ The max it could get would be a 1. I want you to think about what that score means and leave what you think in the comments below. Do you think this is a good model?  So there you have it, that is how you can use python‚Äôs Sklearn to create a linear regression model.

This is the 30th  Video of Python for Data Science Course! In This series I will explain to you Python and Data Science all the time! It is a deep rooted fact, Python is the best programming language for data analysis because of its libraries for manipulating, storing, and gaining understanding from data. Watch this video to learn about the language that make Python the data science powerhouse. Jupyter Notebooks have become very popular in the last few years, and for good reason. They allow you to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations and markdown text. This can all be run from directly in the browser. It is an essential tool to learn if you are getting started in Data Science, but will also have tons of benefits outside of that field. Harvard Business Review named data scientist ""the sexiest job of the 21st century."" Python pandas is a commonly-used tool in the industry to easily and professionally clean, analyze, and visualize data of varying sizes and types. We'll learn how to use pandas, Scipy, Sci-kit learn and matplotlib tools to extract meaningful insights and recommendations from real-world datasets.

169,4H3AGK_hNMA,2018-04-19T12:33:50Z,Getting Started with jOOQ : Building SQL Queries in Java,"JPA and Hibernate are a great fit to implement persist and update use cases, and simple queries. But most applications need a lot more than that. You need to be able to use the full feature set of SQL to implement your queries. That‚Äôs why JPA supports native queries. But it‚Äôs not comfortable to use. You probably don‚Äôt want to provide your query as a simple String or to handle the differences between the various database dialects yourself.
Other libraries are much better suited to implement complex SQL queries. One of them is jOOQ. It provides you with a Java DSL that enables you to build SQL queries in a comfortable and type-safe way. It abstracts the technical difficulties of plain JDBC and handles the subtle differences of the various SQL dialects.
In this video, I will give you a basic introduction to jOOQ so that you can start using it in your application. And in my next video, I will show you how to integrate it with Hibernate. 
Before we get started, please make sure you subscribed to my channel and clicked the bell icon, so that you get new videos every week.

Video Transcript
Time - 00:00
Hello. In this tutorial, you will learn how to connect to a MySQL database with Java. In this session we‚Äôre going to learn how to connect a MySQL database with Java. Before we get started there are some prep work that needs to take place. One is that you need to have a MySQL database already installed. If not, you can download one from the site listed here on the slide. 
 
Time - 00:20
Next, we‚Äôll need to download and install a MySQL JDBC driver. This driver will allow the Java program to connect to the database. You can download it from this URL, and I‚Äôll do that now. I‚Äôll just take this URL, drop it into my favorite browser and here I am at the page. I‚Äôm on this page, this is for downloading the Connector/J browser. I‚Äôll select the platform, platform independent. Now move down and I‚Äôll select download and it will download a zip archive. Make sure you download the most recent version. In this case it‚Äôs 5.1.29. Make sure you download something at that version or later. 

Time - 01:04
Download, scroll down, select, ‚ÄúNo thanks, just start my download.‚Äù This will start downloading the file for you. Now what we can do is show it in the finder. I‚Äôll double click it to extract it. At this point I have the driver extracted. There‚Äôs a file in here called MySQL connector.jar that we‚Äôll use later. 

Time - 01:34
Next, what I need to do is create a Java project in Eclipse. Let‚Äôs do that. On Eclipse I‚Äôll say I‚Äôll save file, new, Java project. This will be JDBC demo and I will select finish. What I‚Äôll do is I will add a new class. New, class, this will be my driver and it will have a public static void main region. At this point we have a shell for our project created.  

Time - 02:28
Next, what we‚Äôll do is we will talk to the actual development process and I really like this slide because it outlines exactly what we need to do. The first thing we‚Äôll do is add the database driver to the classpath. Next, we‚Äôll get a connection, we‚Äôll submit a SQL query and then we‚Äôll process the result set. 

Time - 02:48
Let‚Äôs start with step one, adding a MySQL database driver to the classpath. In our Eclipse project I‚Äôm going to add a new folder called lib, lib for library. In this lib folder I‚Äôm going to add the driver that I downloaded earlier. What I‚Äôll do is I‚Äôll just grab this driver. It‚Äôs the MySQL connector bin.jar and I‚Äôll just drag and drop it to this lib folder. It will prompt me and I‚Äôll say go ahead and copy the file. 

Time - 03:25
Next, I need to add the jar file, the driver to the classpath. I‚Äôve set this up with properties, choose Java build path and then I‚Äôll choose add jars. Expand this folder, that lib, I‚Äôll grab that jar file and I‚Äôll have it setup. Great.

Time - 03:51
Now we can start coding. We need to get a connection, submit a SQL query and process a result set. Let me just sketch this out on a slide over here. The first thing I‚Äôll do up top is I‚Äôll just do an import on java.sql.* because all of the classes and interfaces that we need are in this package. 

Time -  04:17
I‚Äôll also just setup a try catch block just to handle for any exception that may occur. Small typo there. 

Time - 04:40
Inside of this section I‚Äôm going to first get a connection to database. Then next I will create a statement. Then from here I will execute a SQL query and then I will process the result set. 
Time - 05:16
That‚Äôs my basic game plan, let‚Äôs fill it in with some real code. Here I‚Äôll say connection, myConn = DriverManager.getConnection. I‚Äôll give the jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/demo student, student. Student is the user ID and student is also the password.

https://courses.learncodeonline.in/learn/BackEnd-web-development-with-Django

Hi and welcome to BackEnd Development for Beginners using Django - Build 8 Projects. 
Before we talk anything about this course, let‚Äôs get clear about what you should already know before taking this course.

NOTE: This course is on Django 2

Front end basics
If you have taken my Complete front-end developer Bootcamp or any other such course where things like HTML and basics of CSS got cleared, then you are good to go for next requirement. This is a backend focused course and we will not be talking much about stuff like ‚ÄúHow to change background color‚Äù.

2. Python Basics
Django is based on python and it will be a good idea to clear your python basics before taking this course. Things like Loops, If Else, Functions and Classes are used in this course, with expectation that you are aware of it. You don‚Äôt need to be a guru in python but at least syntax should be comfortable for you.


Why Django
While designing BackEnd course, there were a lot of option but I asked a question a that If I could go back in time and suggest me the easiest backend framework to get started, what would it be. Most tech startups use Django because it is easy to implement. You can focus on what you are building instead of other framework issues. 
On top of that, it is backed by Python, One of the top most favorite programming language of people at internet.

What will we be building in this course?
This course is totally focused on beginners. The goal here is not to scare you from programming jargons. Course is totally based on projects and each project will focus on a specific issue that we will deal.

Project 1. - Getting basics of Django
Project 2. - Breaking website into templating
Project 3. - Interaction with Database
Project 4. - Blog with static pages and unique URL
Project 5. - Handling forms and taking input from user
Project 6. - A CRUD blog from user input
Project 7. - A TODO list with sqlite3
Project 8. - Login, Logout and Signup

This course is designed to take you one step closer towards backend development. So, if you are afraid of backend development, worry not. Django is going to help you a lot. 
Let‚Äôs get started.

194,Q3_kKvFeAlI,2021-10-04T12:26:45Z,Django vs. Flask - Best Backend Frameworks for 2021,"Which one is your favorite: #Flask or #Django? ü§ì

- Both are Python frameworks; Django is a very mature framework (from 2005), whereas Flask is much younger (2010). 
- Flask allows you to use multiple types of databases, whereas Django does not.
- To set up a Django project we can use pre-built tools / To set up a Flask project we need to structure everything manually.
- Being an ‚Äúolder‚Äù framework, Django provides more production-ready modules compared to Flask.

In this video I explain my first web application, a simple hotel reservation system having a front-end and a back-end. The editor used was VSCode and the Django framework of Python was used. 
The backend is also written in Python. In addition, the web pages are made using HTML. 

Note that the purpose of this video is just to go over the framework and a basic implementation of a frontend and backend program. 

More complex functions such as back buttons, form reloads / refreshes, username and passwords and databases are not covered.
